# E-commerce Back End

## Description

This is the 'Module 13' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

We were tasked with creating a E-commerce back end from some given starter code to have a way of adding/removing tags, categories, and products. This project gave us practice with working with Express.js (for routing), MySQL (for our database), and Sequelize (for working with relational data).

## Installation

1. Git clone repo into VSCode
2. Right click `ORM-E-commerce-Back-End` folder and select `Open in Integrated Terminal`
3. Then you can the following code below in the terminal
```
npm install
```

## Usage

In the terminal, you can run `npm run seed` if you want to clear the data or to load the data if it's your first time, otherwise you can stick to just `npm start` everytime you start up the project.

```
npm run seed
npm start
```

You'll need a REST API client like Insomnia in order to test out the functionality of the E-commerce API, like what is shown in the demo.
